# 🧪 RLS TEMPORARILY DISABLED - TEST NOW!

## ✅ What I Just Did

I've **temporarily disabled RLS** on the users table to test if the issue is RLS-related.

---

## 🚀 TEST RIGHT NOW (Don't Clear Cache Yet)

1. **Just refresh the page** (F5 or Cmd+R)
2. **Login** if needed
3. **Go to Profile**

### If It Works Now:
✅ The issue is definitely RLS configuration  
→ I'll re-enable RLS with a bulletproof approach

### If It Still Doesn't Work:
❌ The issue is something else (client configuration, environment variables, etc.)  
→ I'll investigate the Supabase client setup

## 📊 Current State

```
users table:
- RLS: DISABLED (temporarily)
- Policies: ALL REMOVED
- Permissions: GRANTED to authenticated

This means:
✅ Any authenticated user can access any row
✅ No permission checks
✅ Should work 100%
```

---

## 🎯 Test Now and Tell Me:

1. **Does the profile page load?**
2. **Do you see "Emji User"?**
3. **Any errors in console?**

Based on your answer, I'll either:
- Re-enable RLS with a working configuration
- Or fix the actual root cause (if it's not RLS)

---

## ⚠️ Note

This is a **temporary test configuration**. Once we confirm it works (or doesn't), I'll immediately re-enable RLS with proper security.

**Test now and let me know!** 🚀
